## Problem Statement:
### -> Nowadays, shopping malls and Big Marts keep track of individual items sales data in order to forecast future client demand and adjust inventory management. In a data warehouse, these data stores hold a significant amount of consumer information and particular item details. By mining the data store from the data warehouse, more anomalies and patterns can be discovered.

## Approach
### -> The classical machine learning tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Model Building and Model Testing. Try out different machine learning algorithms that's best fit for the above case.

## Dataset
### The dataset is taken from kaggle.
### Link :- https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata
### It consists of two csv files one contains movies data while other containts credits related to that movie.






## Tools Used:
### 1. Python 
### 2. Pandas
### 3. Streamlit
### 4. Sklearn
### 5. NLTK
### 7. Pickle
### 8. Requests
### 9. Pybase64
### 10. Heroku




## Platforms Used:
### Jupyter Notebook, Spyder, Github, Heroku 



## Operations Performes:
### 1. Data Collection: 
#### -> Data is taken from kaggle which is a TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset.
### 2. Data Cleaning:
#### -> Dataset may consists of some missing values and duplicate values so we will remove these impurities.
### 3. Feature Selection:
#### -> We will not take all of the feature columns . We will only choose which we think can help us to make recommendations.
### 4. Feature Engineering: 
#### -> For recommendation system we requires some tags which we are gonig to extract from some of the selected features.
### 5. Stemming 
#### -> Performing stemming operations on the tags column using CounterStemming. For that we use python's nltk module. Stemming is the process of reducing a word to its word stem that affixes to suffixes and prefixes or to the roots of words known as a lemma. 
### 6. Hyperparameter Tuning:
#### -> To gain more accuracy on the data we perform hyperparameter tuning. This process take much time but can give us better results.
### 7. Model Evaluation and Selection: 
#### -> We choose our model based on their time taken and R2 value.
### 8. Model Deployment:
#### -> Using flask library the model is deployed on heroku.






## Model Deployment Link:

##### Have a patience it will take a little bit to load.
